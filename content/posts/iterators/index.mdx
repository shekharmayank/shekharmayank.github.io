Iterators are used to point at memory addresses. As the name suggests, iterators can be used to sequentially iterate through memory.


Header that should be included in order to work with iterators is:

`#include <iterator>`

Operations of iterators :-

1. `begin()` :- This function is used to return the beginning position of the container.

2. `end()` :- This function is used to return the end position of the container.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <interator>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  vector<int> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  
  //interator declaration 
  vector<int>::iterator ia;
  
  //usage example of iterator
  for(ia = a.begin(); ia < a.end(); ++ia){
    cout<<*ia<<' ';
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
