So after seeing hundreds of websites that are not mobile friendly I decided to write this post to give little hacks and techniques to make any site mobile friendly.


#### Twitter Bootstrap

Seriously, if you don’t have enough time to give to the design of a web project just do everyone a favour and use Bootstrap. It’s easy to learn and extremely user friendly no matter what device they are using.

#### Viewport

Again if you have extremely less time and don’t want to use Bootstrap then I would recommend using the Viewport property. Just add a meta tag into the head of your html and you would see miracles. This technique is magical in my opinion.

Just add the code given below to the headof your document and see the magic:

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

#### Media Queries

Use media queries if you have enough time to define style for devices with display of different dimensions. Search media query for more information. You can use this along with what is mentioned in point number 2 to get great results.

Happy coding!
